# üè¢ EPO Attendance Project

**A robust, production-grade, real-time attendance and employee management platform deployed for [Eastern Panorama Offset, Shillong](https://www.easternpanorama.com/), built with Node.js, Express, Sequelize, MySQL, and Telegram Bot.**

---

## üì∏ Overview

This application provides an end-to-end solution for digital attendance tracking, shift management, and employee notifications for a busy offset printing company.  
Deployed on the company's in-house server, it automates attendance collection, absence/late detection, and HR reporting, all while keeping employees engaged through Telegram.

---

## üöÄ Live Features

- **Telegram Bot Integration**
  - Employees self-register via `/register` command.
  - Bot automatically notifies employees for missing check-outs.
- **Google Sheets Sync**
  - Fetches attendance logs directly from Google Sheets for backup & reconciliation.
  - Data can be imported and processed for **all historical dates** (not just today), fixing missed syncs/server downtimes.
- **Auto Late/Absent/Shift Tracking**
  - Dynamically marks "Late" and "Absent" based on business logic.
  - Shift times calculated automatically; absent/late marking respects office rules.
  - Automated absent marking for employees who miss check-in before cut-off.
- **Admin Dashboard & API**
  - Real-time dashboard for attendance stats (React.js/Tailwind frontend ready, if used).
  - Detailed API for HR/admin actions: viewing, updating, and exporting attendance data.
- **Automated Cron Jobs**
  - Flexible schedule for data sync, reminders, and reconciliation.
  - Runs every 5 minutes during key hours (configurable).
- **Historical Data Correction**
  - Can retroactively sync/update past days (auto-fixes missing check-outs).
- **Production-Ready Engineering**
  - Direct Sequelize model sync (no migration files; uses robust upsert/update logic).
  - Unique constraints at the DB/model level to prevent duplicate records.
  - Modular, well-organized codebase (controllers, models, routes, utils, scripts).
- **In-House Deployment**
  - Runs on Windows in company premises, fully private and secure.
- **Sample Data & Seed Scripts**
  - Seeder scripts included for quick onboarding of new employees.
  - Bulk sync/insert/clean-up utilities for database hygiene.
- **Secure and Modern**
  - Uses `helmet`, CORS, and environment-based configuration.
  - Secrets and credentials are always in `.env`, never committed.
- **Instant HR Notifications**
  - Real-time alerts for admins about attendance issues or failed syncs.

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### 1. **Clone & Install**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/epo-attendance-project.git
cd epo-attendance-project/backend
npm install
```

### 2. **Environment Setup**

Create a `.env` file in `/backend`:

```ini
DB_USER=your_mysql_user
DB_PASS=your_mysql_pass
DB_NAME=attendance_db
DB_HOST=localhost
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
SHEET_ID=your_google_sheet_id
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
```

### 3. **Database Prep**

Start your MySQL server and create the `attendance_db` database (empty; tables auto-created).

*(Optional) Seed employee data:*

```bash
node utils/seed/addNameInDb.js
```

### 4. **Start the Server**

```bash
node app.js
```

Backend will run at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## ü§ñ Telegram Bot Usage

* `/register` ‚Äì Register your Telegram account with the system
* Employees receive reminders if they forget to check-out.
* Only recognized employees (in TelegramUser table) can register.

---

## üïí Cron Job Schedule

* **Morning + Afternoon:** Every 5 min, 9:00‚Äì13:55 IST
* **Evening:** Every 5 min, 17:00‚Äì20:55 IST
* **Night:** Once at 21:00 IST
  *(Customizable via node-cron)*

## üß© Features Showcase

* **No Duplicates:** Robust DB logic & unique constraints.
* **Flexible Sync:** Full re-sync for all days, correcting for downtime/data loss.
* **Google Sheets Integration:** Pulls/processes data from live Google Sheets logs.
* **Auto Attendance Mapping:** For each employee & day, earliest IN and latest OUT detected.
* **Status Logic:**

  * **PRESENT** if on time
  * **LATE** if after cut-off
  * **ABSENT** if no IN by cutoff
* **Shift Time Calculation:** Accurate calculation of working hours.
* **Admin Tools:** View/export attendance, manage employees, add/remove records.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Best Practices

* `.env` for all credentials and config
* Uses CORS, Helmet, input validation
* Modular and auditable codebase
* No hardcoded secrets

## ‚ú® Why This Project Stands Out

* **Deployed in a real business:** Used daily by all employees at Eastern Panorama Offset.
* **Solves real-world challenges:** Handles downtime, missing check-outs, re-syncs, and more.
* **Clean, scalable code:** No migration hassle, simple and robust upsert logic, instantly extensible.
* **Professional stack:** Modern, secure, and maintainable.
* **Full documentation and easy onboarding for future adopters.**
